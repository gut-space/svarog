'''
The different satellites require different software and configuration.
This is a recipe-based solution. "Recipe" is a script which is responsible
for the signal reception and its decoding.

Each recipe takes three parameters:

* Working directory - it is writable, clean and temporary directory.
* Frequency - transmission frequency in MHz
* Duration - after this time script should stop SDR, in seconds

As output the script returns a dictionary where key is a category
and value is a path or paths to file(s). Currently the following categories
are supported:
- "signal" for initial audio file in WAV format
- "product" or "products" for decoded image

In the future additional categories will be added. Most likely there will be:
- "waterfall" presenting the frequency spectrum changing over time
- "telemetry" for any decoded telemetry data
- "logs" for detailed decoding notes

Other categories are likely to appear.

User should have a possibility to execute recipe in stand alone mode, i.e. without
the whole station code (without any need to initialize the station).

Recipe isn't responsible for clean up. The working directory should be deleted
after file processing. If some files should be kept, then they should be moved
to a safe place.

User has a possibility to select recipe by "recipe" parameter in satellite
config. Now it is optional and script try to deduce recipe based on satellite.
(For example if recipe isn't provided and name starts with NOAA then we use
recipe for NOAA).

All recipes must be located in directory with this file ("recipes") and have
"execute" method which accept all parameters.
