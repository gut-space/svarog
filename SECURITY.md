## Reporting a Vulnerability

Svarog is a small project, run by two volunteers with limited time.
Tomek can be reached at thomson (at) klub (dot) com (dot) pl and SÅ‚awek at
fivitti (at) gmail (dot) com. If you report a vulnerability, we'll try to
address it as soon as possible. However, keep in mind that Svarog is a hobby
project and we have full time jobs and other family responsibilities.
